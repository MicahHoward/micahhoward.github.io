## Projects:
### [Westmont College Mobile App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/westmont/id6538728714) -
I lead a team at CATLab to create Westmont College's mobile app, which is used by most of the students on campus.

### [Manki](https://github.com/MicahHoward/Manki) -
For my senior seminar project I created an app to help people retain math skills. It utilizes the FSRS(insert link here) algorithm to predict when a user might forget the skill, and then it generates a math problem for them to solve.

### Admissions Automation -
I created a program to automate data processing from various sources, such as Common App or the SAT, to a standardized format for input into Salesforce, saving admissons workers multiple hours of work per day.
